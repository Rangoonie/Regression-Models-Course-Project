# Regression-Models-Course-Project
In this analysis, we will be looking at the mtcars dataset in R. Let's pretend we work for Motor Trend, a magazine about the automobile industry. Looking at the collection of cars, we are interested in the relationship between a set of variables and miles per gallon (mpg), our outcome. We are interested in the two questions:

* “Is an automatic or manual transmission better for MPG”
* "Quantify the MPG difference between automatic and manual transmissions"

Our findings show that manual transmission has a larger mean output of mpg than that of automatic transmission. We also find that our linear model comparing mpg to transmission type is not as optimized as a model that compares mpg to transmission type plus other variables such as cylinders, horsepower, and weight included as regressors. This shows that our outcome is correlated with the other variables and can not be left out of our linear models.
